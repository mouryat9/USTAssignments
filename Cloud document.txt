Being the consultant of Alphacom.I really appreciate the growth made by the company.Our revenue have touched 18%.We have been diligent to deliver great product to our client.
For the future of Alphacom I would like to put forward some points which are necessary for the growth of the company.
1.Since our client are mostly belonging to healthcare and banking domain.Hence we need to cloudify our infrastructure.
2. Well Banks and heathcare all the system based for this domain generate real time data and the data is being generated at a very faster pace,
so in order to meet the requirement of client we require cloud as a service
3. Cloud as a service will help us in reducing the cost of admin and installation and will help us manage our business in a efficient way
4. Cloud will help us invest in business more rather than IT.
5. For Banking Cloud will be a fast and secure platform.
6. Since machine learning is a helpful tool for enhancement of business hence we require cloud services to bring AI into the picture.
